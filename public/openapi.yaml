    This service is an API to query current and past R versions
    and installers. You can use it is devops scripts, e.g. for continuous
    integration tools, to query which version(s) or R you want to install.
    It is updated every hour, so a new R release or a new installer is
    typically picked up within on hour.

    ### Format

    This is a JSON API, all responses are JSON.

    ### The R release process

    In the current R release process, there is a new major or minor release
    every year, typically in April. There are also several patch releases.
    Once there is a newer major or minor release, the older major or minor
    releases typically do not get new patch releases. (E.g. once R 3.6.0 is out,
    the R 3.5.x minor branch will not receive more releases.)

    ### Typical use cases

    * To report the currently released version of R, use `/r-release`.
    * To download and compile the currently released version of R, use
      `/r-release-tarball`.
    * To download the latest Windows or macOS installer, use `/r-release-win`
      or `/r-release-macos`, respectively.
    * To report or download the source or an installer for the latest release
      or the penultimate R minor branch (R-oldrel as CRAN calls it), use
      `/r-oldrel`.
